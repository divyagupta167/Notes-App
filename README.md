Notes App Readme
The Notes App is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage notes in their browser. It provides a straightforward interface for adding, editing, and deleting notes, all while storing the data locally in the user's browser using the browser's Local Storage feature.

Getting Started
To use the Notes App, simply open the index.html file in a web browser that supports modern web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6. No internet connection is required as the application runs locally within the browser.

Features
Add Note: Clicking on the "Add Note" button (identified by a plus icon) adds a new note to the application. The notes are displayed as white rectangles on a blue background.

Edit Note: Each note contains a text area where users can type and edit their notes.

Save Note: When the user finishes editing a note or clicks the save icon (identified by a floppy disk icon) in the top-right corner of the note, the note content is saved to the browser's Local Storage. This allows users to close the application and return later to find their notes still available.

Delete Note: If a user wants to remove a specific note, they can click the delete icon (identified by a trash can icon) in the top-right corner of the note. The note will be permanently removed from the application, and the updated list of notes will be saved to Local Storage.

Styling
The application has a simple, minimalist design. Notes are presented as white rectangles on a blue background. The top-right corner of each note contains two icons, one for saving changes and another for deleting the note.

Compatibility
The Notes App should work on most modern web browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and others. It has been designed to be responsive and should adapt to different screen sizes, including mobile devices.

Storage
The application uses the browser's Local Storage feature to store notes locally on the user's device. This means that the notes will be accessible only from the same device and browser that they were created on. Clearing the browser data or using a different browser may result in the loss of the notes.


The Notes App is a simple project intended for personal use and as a basic example for learning web development.
